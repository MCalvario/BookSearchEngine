# BookSearchEngine

## Description
As a full-stack web develop, I want to create an app where avid readers can search for new books to read so that they can keep a list of books to purchase.

## Usage

to use this book search engine, load the search engine to be presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button. Click on the Search for Books menu option to be presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button.  When you are not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, you will be presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site. Click on the Login/Signup menu option for a modal to appear on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up.  When the toggle is set to Signup, you will be presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button. When the toggle is set to Login, you will be presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button. Enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button for your user account to be created and to be logged in to the site. Enter your account’s email address and password and click on the login button and the modal closes and I am logged in to the site. Once you are logged in to the site, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout. Once logged in, enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button to be presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account. Click on the Save button on a book for that book’s information to be saved to your account. Click on the option to see your saved books and you will be presented with all of the books you have saved to your account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from your account. Click on the Remove button on a book and that book is deleted from your saved books list. Click on the Logout button, to be logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button.
